## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest version of `Amadeus` from [here](https://github.com/Markneoneo/ip).
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved the application and run the following command:
   ```
   java -jar amadeus.jar
   ```
4. Amadeus will greet you with a welcome message. You can start using the chatbot immediately!

Amadeus heavily utilizes ANSI text formatting and styling, as well as UTF-8 emojis.
If you are running your program in cmd.exe (Windows Command Prompt), it does not support ANSI codes by default.
Use Windows Terminal, PowerShell, or Git Bash, which have better support for ANSI sequences.
```
javac -encoding UTF-8 -d . amadeus/*.java
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 amadeus.Amadeus
```

## Features

### 1. **Adding Tasks**
Amadeus supports three types of tasks: **ToDo**, **Deadline**, and **Event**.

#### Add a ToDo Task
Adds a simple task with no specific date or time.

**Format:**
```
todo DESCRIPTION
```

**Example:**
```
todo Buy groceries
```

---

#### Add a Deadline Task
Adds a task with a specific deadline.

**Format:**
```
deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE_TIME
```

- `DATE_TIME` can be in the following formats:
  - Date only: `2/12/2025`, `2-12-2025`, or `2 12 2025`.
  - Date and time (24-hour): `2/12/2025 1800`, `2/12/2025 18:00`, or `2/12/2025 18.00`.
  - Date and time (12-hour): `2/12/2025 6pm`, `2/12/2025 6:00PM`, or `2/12/2025 6.30AM`.

```

- `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` follow the same format as `DATE_TIME` in the Deadline task.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I save my tasks?**  
A: Tasks are automatically saved to a file (`Memory.txt`) in the same directory as the application. You donâ€™t need to manually save anything.

**Q: Can I edit a task after adding it?**  
A: Currently, Amadeus does not support direct editing of tasks. You can delete the task and add a new one with the updated details.

**Q: What happens if I close the application without typing `bye`?**  
A: Your tasks will still be saved, but itâ€™s recommended to use the `bye` command to ensure a clean exit.
