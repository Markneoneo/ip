## ✍️ What I Can Do

I’m designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. Here’s what I can do for you:

- **Add Tasks**: Keep track of your to-dos, deadlines, and events.
- **View Tasks**: See all your tasks at a glance or search for specific ones.
- **Mark Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Reset Tasks**: Clear your entire task list if you want a fresh start.

Using me is simple! Just type commands to add, view, or manage your tasks.

## ⚠️ UI Compatibility

Amadeus uses **ANSI text formatting** and **UTF-8 emojis** for a rich experience. For the best UI, open the interface in Fullscreen:

- **Git Bash, Windows Terminal or IntelliJ**:  
  - For `.jar` files:  
    ```
    java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar Amadeus.jar
    ```
  - For compiling:  
    ```
    javac -encoding UTF-8 -d . amadeus/*.java
    java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 amadeus.Amadeus
    ```

- **Windows PowerShell and cmd.exe**: Works but **no emojis**:  
  ```
  java '-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8' -jar Amadeus.jar
  ```
